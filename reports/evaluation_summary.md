Generated automatically: **2026-08-07 19:57 UTC**.

## Business question

Which forecast provider is most accurate for daily maximum temperature in Torrevieja at D+3?

## Method

The pipeline stores daily provider forecasts, stores observed daily maximum temperatures, matches `target_date` to the actual observation date, and ranks providers by MAE.

Lower MAE means a more accurate provider for this location and horizon.

## Current result

No completed comparisons yet.

This is expected until a stored D+3 forecast has a matching observed actual temperature.
